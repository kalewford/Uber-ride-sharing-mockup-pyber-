**Uber ride sharing analysis**
==============================


*Analysis*

  * **Rural** - Because of reduced % population, ride sharing companies are almost non existant. The average fare for this city type varies due to traveling distances most people make of the upwards 30+ miles. 
  * **Suburban - We see the trend start to accumulate in a more observable manner. Population seems to be the key factor here. Ranging from around 8-23 rides per city, the average fare is around $16.
  * **Urban** - Here we an absolute corrolation between the number of drivers and population. It is clear that an urban city will have a higher demand for Pyber!
